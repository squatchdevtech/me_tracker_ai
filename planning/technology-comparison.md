- Excellent performance
- Built-in security
- Global tables for multi-region

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in (AWS)
- Different query patterns
- Limited complex queries
- Can be expensive at scale
- Learning curve for NoSQL

**Best for:** Serverless architectures, high-scale applications, AWS ecosystem

## Selected Technology Stack

**Chosen Stack:** Node.js/Express + MySQL
- **Rationale**: Fastest to develop with familiar technology
- **Benefits**: 
  - JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across frontend and backend
  - Large ecosystem and community support
  - Easy deployment and management
  - Excellent for rapid prototyping and MVP development
  - Strong MySQL integration with Prisma/TypeORM

## Scaling Strategy

1. **Phase 1:** Node.js + MySQL (MVP)
2. **Phase 2:** Add Redis caching layer
3. **Phase 3:** Implement database read replicas
4. **Phase 4:** Consider microservices architecture if needed
5. **Phase 5:** Evaluate serverless options for specific services
